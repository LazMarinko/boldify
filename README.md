This is python code and an executable that reads through any .docx file that its given and then makes the first half of every word in the .docx file bold, then makes an edited file with the changes its made


Provided here is the source code and the executable. You can just download the .exe file if you want to use it without looking at any of the source code.

The way it works is that you download any text file as a .docx that you want to change into the format that this file provides. Run the program and select it on the combo box, when you do press on the "Make ADHD readible" button.
The purpose of this program is to allow people with ADHD to easily and quickly read through any files by bolding the first half of every word in the provided file.

Enjoy, and for further updates stay tuned
